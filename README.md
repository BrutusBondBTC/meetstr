# Meetstr

This is a template to create your very own bitcoin-only ~~meetup~~ beacon homepage. The idea is to do something simmilar to [this](https://twentyone.world/) in a city near you.I have already met a couple peeople using this I created a sim[le bot to automate answers to questions like Where is the meetup.  

## This is a work in progress, but the idea is to create local meetups in cyberspace using nostr.

* TODO:  Add a video tutorial that teaches people how to modify it for their own local meetup.

* TODO: add bot tutorial.
