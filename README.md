# Meetstr

This is a template to create your very own bitcoin-only ~~meetup~~ beacon homepage. The idea is to do something simmilar to [this](https://twentyone.world/) in a city near you.

## This is a work in progress, but the idea is to create local meetups in cyberspace using nostr.
TODO:  Add a video tutorial that teaches people how to modify it for their own local meetup.
TODO: Add a simple telegram bot. My goal is to learn how to make nostr telegram bridge bots, but I'm not sure how to do this yet.
